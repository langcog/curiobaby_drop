octahedron-pipe vs -sphere,,,Key
Q18 -1a,,,preference matches our goal-specific intuition
Octahedron,,,preference for alternative is entropy-oriented
Do you want to drop this on:,Why did you make that choice?,,"preference for alternative is a conflicting, alternative goal intution"
pipe,I wanted to see if the pointy part would hit the hole and catch it.,,preference reason is general 
pipe,the sphere will just roll,,
sphere,I felt it may bounce further.,,
pipe,I wanted to see if when it was dropped would it fit in the center hole.,,
pipe,because maybe it would fit in the hole,,
sphere,"to see what happens, cant think of anything deep as an answer.",,
pipe,I like to see what would happen if it dropped in the whole,,
pipe,It seemed like it could be fun to drop the square parts into the opening on the toy on the ground.,,
pipe,wanted to see if it would stick in the hole,,
pipe,I feel perfect.,,
sphere,I like this.,,

Q18 -1b,,,
Octahedron,,,
Do you want to drop this on:,Why did you make that choice?,,
pipe,I thought it might fit over or in the object.,,
sphere,The toys fit together.,,
sphere,I feel it will be the most interesting to see.,,
pipe,I wanted the shape to land on top of the other.,,
pipe,it looked like it fit,,
pipe,NOT BROKEN IT STAND WITH ANOTHER TOY,,
pipe,the point might go in the hole,,
sphere,It'd make the ball roll.,,

pyramid-torus vs -dumbbell,,,
Q24 -2a,,,
Pyramid,,,
Do you want to drop this on:,Why did you make that choice?,,
torus,I want to make a basket inside the donut,,
torus,To see if it would fit in the hole,,
torus,I thought it would be fun to try and get the point into the hole.,,
torus,I made it base on the shape combinations,,
torus,I wondered if the point would hit in the middle of the circle.,,
torus,some connetcion between the object,,
torus,Because I think the shape might make it fit in the circle.,,
torus,to see if i could get the pyramid in the center of the other toy,,
torus,Because I thought that the shape chosen was similar and could fit a little more with the other shape,,

pyramid-torus vs -dumbbell,,,
Q24 -2c,,,
Pyramid,,,
Do you want to drop this on:,Why did you make that choice?,,
torus,try to get the wedge in the donut hole,,
torus,"If you drop it right, the pyramid might go in the hole of the torus.",,
torus,Because the top of the pyramid will fall into the doughnut hole.,,
torus,By joining both toys we get a good combination.,,
torus,that is only interesting,,
torus,Because the point of the pyramid might wedge inside the hole in the donut.,,
dumbbell,I think it could bounce and make more movement than the other choice,,
