bowl-torus vs -trig prism,,,Key
Q37 -1a,,,preference matches our goal-specific intuition
Bowl,,,preference for alternative is entropy-oriented
Do you want to drop this on:,Why did you make that choice?,,"preference for alternative is a conflicting, alternative goal intution"
torus,I thought it would be cool to see if I could get it to cover the donut toy,,preference reason is general 
torus,to bounce and avoid sharp edge,,
torus,I thought maybe it may by accident make a different shape if it landed correctly.,,
torus,I wanted to see if the half dome would land on the donut and stay.,,
torus,because i thought it would be cool to see what it did,,
torus,"no specific reason, just want to see want would happen",,
trig prism,I imagined in my mind which one would be most interesting,,
torus,It seemed like it could be fun if you could drop it exactly on top to make it sit on top of the circle toy.,,
trig prism,I thought it might bounce far,,
torus,I feel perfect.,,
torus,I like this.,,

torus-bowl vs -octahedron,,,
Q26 -1b,,,
Torus,,,
Do you want to drop this on:,Why did you make that choice?,,
octahedron,I thought the object dropped may fit over the object I chose.,,
octahedron,The toys fit together.,,
octahedron,This interaction will be way more action than the other one.,,
bowl,I wanted this shape to land on top of the other.,,
octahedron,It might fit over the pyramid,,
bowl,I THINK THE TOY MATCH THE TOY IS BEST CHOICE,,
octahedron,i dont know maybe the donut hole will land on it funny,,
octahedron,It'd land on that toy.,,

pyramid-trigprism vs -sphere,,,
Q33 -2a,,,
Pyramid,,,
Do you want to drop this on:,Why did you make that choice?,,
sphere,I want to hit the tip of the pyramid with the ball,,
trig prism,similar in shape,,
trig prism,"I thought it would be fun to try and make it land right on top of the toy in the bin, as opposed to it just flying off.",,
trig prism,I made it due to my observations and the shapes,,
trig prism,I was wondering if the dropped triangle would stay on the triangle it hit.,,
trig prism,FOrmat are similar,,
trig prism,I think it would make the most interesting effect because the shapes are somewhat similar.,,
sphere,unpredictable result,,
trig prism,Because I thought that the shape chosen was similar and could fit a little more with the other shape,,
,,,
dumbbell-pentagon vs -octahedron,,,
Q27 -2b,,,
Dumbbell,,,
Do you want to drop this on:,Why did you make that choice?,,
pentagon,thought it would be interesting,,
octahedron,Those two objects looked like they might move more when they collide.,,
pentagon,I guess because it felt better than dropping it on the other one even though I don't think either of these work well with the dropped toy.,,
octahedron,I am interested to know what happen when I drop the toy on the toy 1.,,
pentagon,that is only interesting,,
pentagon,"Because the dumbell shape might rest on top of the block shape, but not the pyramid shape.",,
octahedron,,,
